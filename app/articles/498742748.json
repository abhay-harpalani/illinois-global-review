    "body": "<p><strong>The UN Report</strong></p>\r\n<p>The UN Independent International Commision of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Israel, has released a <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session60/advance-version/a-hrc-60-crp-3.pdf\">72 page report</a> accusing Israel of genocide against the Palestinians. The Commission concluded in their September 16 report that \u201cthere was no military necessity to justify the pattern of conduct\u201d of Israeli security forces (pg 54). It also called out specific members of the Israeli government-- including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu-- for \u201cstatements that indicated their intention to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a group\u201d (pg. 51-53) and that the statements \u201care direct evidence of genocidal intent\u201d (pg. 64). The report comes the same day that Israel launched a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-city-incursion-09-16-25-intl-hnk#cmfkmanph001d3b6ndpgco5xd\">\u201cground incursion\u201d</a> into Gaza City following the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/07/middleeast/israel-full-conquest-gaza-key-meeting-thursday-intl\">approval of the Israeli security cabinet.</a></p>\r\n<p>The Independent Commission was headed by <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/coiopt-israel/commissioners\">Navanetham Pillay</a> of South Africa before her <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/us/2025/07/15/navi-pillay-israel-un-resigns/\">resignation</a> in July due to her age, health issues, and \u201cother commitments.\u201d Pillay has held a number of both national and international judicial positions, including as a judge for the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Rwanda-genocide-of-1994/Aftermath#ref1111312\">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a>, which prosecuted perpetrators of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Rwanda-genocide-of-1994\">Rwandan genocide</a>. Pillay said in a statement that the international community must act, and that \u201cevery day of inaction costs lives and erodes the credibility of the international community.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>Page 68 of the report concludes that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza, \u201cnamely for the acts enumerated under <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/definition\">articles II(a)-(d) of the Genocide Convention</a>,\u201d which originally enshrined the crime of genocide in international law. Only one of the five acts needs to be committed in order to constitute genocide. The report found that four out of the five criteria were met, the exception being forcible transfer of children. The four criteria met are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>Killing members of the group: the commission notes the use of \u201cunguided bombs and other heavy munitions\u201d in heavily populated areas. It also notes that more than half of those killed were women, children, and elderly persons and that 83% of casualties were civilians, citing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war\">report from the Guardian</a> (pg. 55).</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group: the Commission notes multiple instances of serious bodily or mental harm, including \u201cwidespread and systematic\u201d sexual violence against both male and female detainees. For example, a detainee was forced to strip and ordered to kiss the Israeli flag, and that after refusing he was \u201cbeaten, and his genitals had been kicked so severely that he had vomited and lost consciousness\u201d (pg. 21-22). Women were also \u201cphotographed without their consent and in degrading circumstances, including in their underwear in front of male soldiers, and these photographs were often posted on social media\u201d (pg. 22).</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part: the commission notes the destruction of bakeries providing food to Palestinians in refugee camps, damage to 110 cultural and religious sites (both pg. 28), and that \u201cIsraeli security forces have deliberately killed, wounded, arrested, detained, mistreated and tortured medical personnel and targeted medical vehicles\u201d (pg. 29). It also notes the blocking of humanitarian aid and utilities from entering Gaza (pg. 35).</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group: the Commission noted the intentional destruction of Al-Basma IVF clinic, the largest fertility clinic in Gaza, which led to the loss of all reproductive material within the genetic bank and embryology laboratory (pg. 47). The commission said this was \u201ccalculated to prevent births of Palestinians in Gaza\u201d (pg. 61-62).</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!-- -->\r\n<!-- -->\r\n<p>The report also notes in its \u201cPattern of Conduct\u201d section (beginning on pg. 54) that the State of Israel committed a number of war crimes, including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyr154314vo\">sexual violence</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-hamas-palestinians-aid-explainer-ecc0e70d5ff1120a04bf36626dfd96f4\">blocking aid</a> that indicate intentions to \u201cdestroy\u201d the Palestinians as a group. Perhaps most notably, the commission acknowledges that these events \u201cwere preceded by decades of unlawful occupation and unlawful settlement, with racial segregation or apartheid\u201d (pg. 54).</p>\r\n<p>Some of the statements quoted by the commission as evidence of genocidal intent also appeared in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/16/the-language-being-used-to-describe-palestinians-is-genocidal\">October 2023 opinion piece</a> by Guardian reporter Chris McGeal, who covered the Rwandan genocide, titled \u201cThe language being used to describe Palestinians is genocidal.\u201d Such examples include Israeli President Isaac Herzog\u2019s speech where he stated \u201cIt\u2019s an entire nation out there that is responsible. This rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, it\u2019s absolutely not true. They could\u2019ve risen up, they could have fought against that evil regime,\u201d as well as former defense minister Yoav Gallant\u2019s statement that Israel was fighting \u201chuman animals.\u201d Chris McGeal also noted that the rhetoric of \u201cself defense\u201d was present in the Rwandan genocide.</p>\r\n<p>The UN report is the latest in what some are calling a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/israel/israel-committing-genocide-gaza-un-commission-inquiry-rcna231565\">\u201cgrowing chorus\u201d</a> of activists, scholars, and human rights organizations calling Israel\u2019s campaign genocidal. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/11/middleeast/south-africa-israel-genocide-icj-hague-day-one-intl/index.html\">South Africa accused Israel of genocide</a> in an International Court of Justice case, saying the country was \u201cintent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the Palestinian Territories Occupied since 1967, released a report in mid June titled <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/country-reports/ahrc5923-economy-occupation-economy-genocide-report-special-rapporteur\">\u201cFrom economy of occupation to economy of genocide,\u201d</a> which examined corporate entities involved in Israeli occupation of Palestine. This led to the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/07/sanctioning-lawfare-that-targets-u-s-and-israeli-persons/\">issuing sanctions</a> against the UN Human Rights Council-appointed legal scholar. The International Association of Genocide Scholars declared in a <a href=\"https://genocidescholars.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IAGS-Resolution-on-Gaza-FINAL.pdf\">statement</a> on August 31 that Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza constitute genocide. On September 11, US senators Chris van Hollen and Jeff Merkley issued a <a href=\"https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/van_hollen_merkley_report_following_2025_codel_to_gaza_border_israel_west_bank_jordan_and_egypt.pdf\">report</a> after a fact-finding mission in the region in which they accused Israel of committing ethnic cleansing. Israel has consistently denied such accusations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>International Responses</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/09/israel-opt-un-report-concluding-israel-is-committing-genocide-in-gaza-must-spur-international-action/\">Amnesty International</a> responded to the report urging international action to \u201cfulfill their legal and moral obligation\u201d and calling for diplomatic, economic, and political pressure against Israel.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/middleeast/israel-gaza-genocide-un-commission-report-intl\">The Israeli foreign ministry says</a> it \u201ccategorically rejects the distorted and false report and calls for the immediate abolition of the Commission of Inquiry\u201d and accused it of relying on \u201cHamas falsehoods.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>Hadja Lahbib, the EU Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness, and Crisis Management, <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/eu-commissioner-urges-action-after-un-inquiry-declares-israel-is-committing-genocide-in-gaza/3690696\">stated</a> at the opening of an art exhibition in Brussels \"It is our responsibility, all the UN nations, to stop it\" in reference to the genocide.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/cruz-slams-uns-israel-genocide-charge-pushes-consequences?msockid=33fde5664d4664761d10f0f04c246564\">Ted Cruz responded</a> calling the report \u201cno different than any of the other antisemitic smears\u201d and that it \u201cdirectly undermines American national security interests.\u201d He also said the US has tools at their disposal, such as sanctions, that \u201cshould be used against everyone involved.\u201d Other US officials have not responded as of September 22, but the US has historically allied with Israel and denied accusations of genocide leveled against them.</p>"
