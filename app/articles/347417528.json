    "body": "<p>Imagine pouring your hopes, savings, and trust into building your dream home, only to be forced to sign it away because of fine print in the loan agreement you didn\u2019t fully understand. That painful scenario mirrors what many nations have experienced under <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/regional-integration/brief/belt-and-road-initiative\">China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)</a>. Promoted as a grand vision for connectivity and economic growth, the BRI often arrives not just with cranes and concrete, but with legal contracts so intricate and opaque that they gradually erode national control. These <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/task-force-report/chinas-belt-and-road-implications-for-the-united-states/findings#:~:text=Finally%2C%20debt%20distress%20that%20results%20in%20countries,concessions%20in%20ways%20that%20undermine%20U.S.%20interests.\">agreements</a> frequently include mechanisms such as long-term leases, exclusive operating rights, and dispute settlement procedures that sideline domestic courts. These are not mere clauses; they are tools of sustained influence. This is what I call a legal <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Trojan-horse\">Trojan horse</a>: a development project that appears to bring gifts but conceals legal instruments that entrench China\u2019s hold over critical infrastructure and weaken the sovereignty of the borrowing nation. Its power is in disguise, invited through the gates under the banner of friendship.</p>\r\n<p>The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping under the slogan <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative\">\"One Belt, One Road,\"</a> later rebranded to emphasize cooperation and inclusivity. On the surface, the initiative revives the historic <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silk-Road-trade-route\">Silk Road</a> through massive investments in infrastructure, connecting China with Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. To date, over 140 countries have signed on, representing nearly <a href=\"https://greenfdc.org/countries-of-the-belt-and-road-initiative-bri/\">40% of global GDP</a>. The <a href=\"https://greenfdc.org/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2023-h1/\">projects</a> span the construction of railways, highways, ports, power plants, and industrial zones. High\u2011speed rail links such as the electrified standard\u2011gauge <a href=\"https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/aldc2018d6_en.pdf\">Addis\u202fAbaba\u2013Djibouti Railway</a> have <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/ethiopia-roads-railways-and-logistics\">dramatically reduced</a> transit times and costs, cutting a journey that once took days by road to about 12\u202fhours by rail, while slashing logistical expenses to a fraction of previous levels. Deep-water ports like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwadar_Port\">Gwadar in Pakistan</a> and <a href=\"https://orcasia.org/article/1099/the-port-of-chancay-and-chinas-evolving-bri\">Chancay in Peru</a> function as <a href=\"https://www.tearline.mil/public_page/bri-maritime-dual-use-hypothetical\">maritime gateways</a> and logistics hubs, anchoring adjacent industrial activity. Power plants and energy corridors, such as those built under the <a href=\"https://cpec.gov.pk/\">China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor</a>, aim to ease chronic electricity shortages. Industrial parks along these transport and energy nodes attract investment and create jobs by clustering production near infrastructure hubs.  In theory, this seems like a win\u2011win: developing nations gain infrastructure they desperately need, while China expands its markets and geopolitical footprint. But behind the glossy brochures are contracts, often undisclosed to the public, that embed legally binding terms advantageous to Chinese state\u2011owned firms. These contracts rarely allow for meaningful renegotiation, even during economic crises. In many cases, the host country must rely on international arbitration rather than its own legal systems, leaving it with limited recourse when deals sour.</p>\r\n<p>One of the most cited examples of this phenomenon is Pakistan. Under the $62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), China has funded roads, pipelines, energy plants, and the development of Gwadar Port. While these investments improved infrastructure and created jobs, they also added to Pakistan\u2019s debt burden. By 2023, the country owed China nearly <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/how-chinese-loans-trapped-pakistans-economy/a-69841139\">$30 billion</a>, about a third of its total external debt. In 2022, a <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/task-force-report/chinas-belt-and-road-implications-for-the-united-states/findings\">balance-of-payments crisis</a> led to fuel shortages, blackouts, and widespread protests. Electricity bills doubled even as access remained poor, and the Pakistani rupee sharply depreciated. While CPEC loans were not the sole cause of the crisis, Pakistan has long struggled with current account deficits and <a href=\"https://www.orfonline.org/research/pakistan-and-the-imf-a-cycle-of-dependency-and-the-need-for-genuine-reform\">IMF dependency</a>. The legal structure of these loans, with limited avenues for renegotiation and exclusive rights for Chinese firms, left the government with few options. According to independent reviews, some <a href=\"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/cpec-dues-soar-to-pkr-423-billion-amid-pakistans-fiscal-mismanagement-mounting-debt-crisis/\">CPEC agreements</a> even include clauses that restrict Pakistan\u2019s regulatory authority, raising concerns about sovereignty and potential legal entrapment.</p>\r\n<p>Sri Lanka offers a similarly complex case with its <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-china-port-idUSKBN1E61ZY\">Hambantota Port</a>. After borrowing billions from Chinese lenders to build the port, Sri Lanka <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/asia/china-sri-lanka-port.html\">failed</a> to meet its debt obligations. In 2017, it agreed to lease the port and 15,000 acres of adjacent land to <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative\">China Merchants Port Holdings</a> for 99 years. This lease was not just a temporary measure; it was a transfer of strategic national territory through contract law. It sparked concern that China was using debt as a pretext to secure long-term control over strategic assets. However, it is worth noting that this case is heavily contested. Many analysts, including those cited in The Atlantic, argue that Sri Lanka\u2019s debt distress was caused largely by domestic <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/08/debunking-myth-debt-trap-diplomacy/4-sri-lanka-and-bri\">fiscal mismanagement</a> and unrelated <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/08/debunking-myth-debt-trap-diplomacy/4-sri-lanka-and-bri\">international borrowing</a>. Only a fraction of Sri Lanka\u2019s external debt, <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2022/12/demystifying-chinas-role-in-sri-lankas-debt-restructuring/\">approximately 10%</a>, was owed to China at the time of the deal. Yet the symbolism of a Chinese company running a key port for nearly a century, along a major shipping lane, has made Hambantota a fixture in discussions about <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/08/debunking-myth-debt-trap-diplomacy/4-sri-lanka-and-bri\">\u201cdebt-trap diplomacy.\u201d</a></p>\r\n<p>Kenya, another high-profile BRI partner, has also raised red flags. Chinese loans have helped finance major projects, such as the <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Otele_A%20Case%20Study%20of%20Kenya%E2%80%99s%20Standard%20Gauge%20Railway.pdf\">Standard Gauge Railway (SGR)</a>, which links Mombasa to Nairobi. But critics say the cost of the railway, around <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/chinas-belt-and-road-leaves-kenya-with-a-railroad-to-nowhere/articleshow/70296987.cms?from=mdr\">$3.6 billion</a>, was inflated, and questions remain about the terms of the loan. Some reports have even speculated that Kenya\u2019s strategic assets, like Mombasa Port, were at <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/12/response-debt-distress-africa-and-role-china/02-case-studies-chinese-lending-africa\">risk of seizure</a> in the event of default, although the <a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/253388/1/sais-cari-wp52.pdf\">Kenyan government</a> has denied this. According to research by Chatham House, <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/05/kenyas-debt-struggles-go-far-deeper-chinese-loans\">Kenya\u2019s economic vulnerability</a> predated BRI involvement, and Chinese lending merely compounded existing challenges. Still, the broader concern remains: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/china-debt-banking-loans-financial-developing-countries-collapse-8df6f9fac3e1e758d0e6d8d5dfbd3ed6\">opaque loan terms</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311886.2024.2399296?utm_source=chatgpt.com#abstract\">arbitration clauses</a> that bypass courts, and <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/\">exclusivity deals</a> for Chinese firms limit a country\u2019s ability to respond to future challenges on its terms.</p>\r\n<p>In Africa, Zambia became the <a href=\"https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2025/01/09/the-zambian-debt-default-a-structuralist-perspective/#:~:text=In%20November%202020%2C%20Zambia%20became,a%20payment%20of%20%2442.5%20million.\">first country</a> on the continent to default on its debt during the COVID-19 pandemic. Around <a href=\"https://www.voaafrica.com/a/china-holds-back-while-zambia-hurts/6596647.html\">one-third</a> of its $17 billion external debt was owed to Chinese creditors. The <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-15-africa-china-debt-distress-vines-et-al.pdf\">lack of transparency</a> surrounding those loans complicated negotiations with other lenders, delaying debt restructuring efforts and prolonging the crisis. The <a href=\"https://media.odi.org/documents/The_evolution_of_Chinas_lending_practices_on_the_Belt_and_Road_ODI_template.pdf\">legal mechanisms</a> used in BRI deals, such as collateralization of future earnings, confidentiality clauses, and arbitration in foreign jurisdictions, can entrench dependency and limit fiscal flexibility. </p>\r\n<p>Countries like <a href=\"https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/trapped-debt-china-s-role-laos-economic-crisis\">Laos</a>, <a href=\"https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/aldc2018d6_en.pdf\">Djibouti</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/task-force-report/chinas-belt-and-road-implications-for-the-united-states/findings\">Montenegro</a> have also faced scrutiny. In Laos, Chinese-backed railway projects have ballooned the national debt and created <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2020/09/laos-stumbles-under-rising-chinese-debt-burden/\">long-term repayment obligations</a>. In <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/montenegro-billion-dollar-chinese-highway/32217524.html\">Montenegro</a>, a highway financed by China left the government scrambling for funds. Montenegro turned to the European Union for help restructuring the Chinese loan, but <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-montenegro-billion-dollar-china-unfinished-highway-loan/\">Brussels declined</a> to assume the debt, offering only <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/business/eu-says-it-cant-help-montenegro-on-china-loan-but-can-on-financing-idUSKBN2BZ22P\">technical assistance</a>. The government later refinanced part of the loan through <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/montenegro-exits-deal-chinese-highway-loan/32469505.html\">Western banks</a>. These examples underscore how legal design, not just loan size, can become the real constraint on sovereignty.</p>\r\n<p>However, the narrative of \u201cdebt-trap diplomacy\u201d is not without its critics. China has repeatedly denied that it uses debt as a coercive tool, and several scholars have backed that claim. They argue that many BRI participants <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2020-08-25-debunking-myth-debt-trap-diplomacy-jones-hameiri.pdf\">actively sought</a> Chinese financing when Western alternatives were slow, conditional, or unavailable. Unlike loans from the EU or IMF, which often come with <a href=\"https://som.yale.edu/blog/eu-programs-supporting-non-eu-countries\">demands</a> for political and governance reforms, Chinese financing is advertised as <a href=\"https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2018/10/06/no-strings-attached-chinas-debt-trap-diplomacy-in-africa\">\u201cno strings attached.\u201d</a> This is especially appealing to governments wary of international scrutiny. Yet this very flexibility on the surface masks restrictive legal frameworks underneath. <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/mrcbg/working.papers/Final_AWP_248_0.pdf\">Debt forgiveness</a> is rare. <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/gdp/files/2023/04/GCI_PB_018_Chinas_OLDF_FIN.pdf?\">Contract transparency</a> is almost nonexistent, and restructuring tends to be short-term, involving temporary payment deferrals rather than substantive renegotiation.</p>\r\n<p>Recognizing the risks, a growing number of countries have started pushing back. India has been one of the <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brazil-becomes-second-brics-country-after-india-not-to-join-chinas-bri/article68809530.ece\">most vocal critics</a> of the BRI, describing it as part of China\u2019s <a href=\"https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/chinas-string-pearls/\">\u201cString of Pearls\u201d</a> strategy, an alleged attempt to encircle India through a series of maritime outposts funded by Chinese loans. In response, India has invested heavily in alternative infrastructure development in its neighborhood, including over <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-indias-afghan-investment-7406795/\">$3 billion in Afghanistan</a>. Alongside Japan, India also co-launched the <a href=\"https://www.isdp.eu/publication/asia-africa-growth-corridor-aagc-india-japan/\">Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC)</a> to provide a more democratic model of development cooperation. However, the AAGC has <a href=\"https://www.idsa.in/askanexpert/omkar-shelar-asked-why-is-the-asia-africa-growth-corridor-aagc-not-gaining-pace-and-how-will-it-affect-indias-influence-compared-to-that-of-china-in-africa\">struggled</a> with visibility, coordination, and funding. It simply is not able to match the pace or scale of the BRI.</p>\r\n<p>In Europe, responses to the BRI are mixed. <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/10/chinas-influence-in-southeastern-central-and-eastern-europe-vulnerabilities-and-resilience-in-four-countries?lang=en\">Some countries</a>, like Greece and Hungary, have welcomed Chinese investment, especially in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/156225/adbi-wp370.pdf\">Eurozone crisis</a>. The Port of Piraeus, managed by <a href=\"https://bulletin.ids.ac.uk/index.php/idsbo/article/view/3065/3045\">COSCO</a>, is a flagship example of China\u2019s growing foothold in Southern Europe. But concerns about strategic autonomy and unfair trade practices have led to pushback from the European Union. In 2021, the EU launched the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/stronger-europe-world/global-gateway_en\">Global Gateway</a> initiative, pledging up to <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/stronger-europe-world/global-gateway_en\">$300 billion</a> for sustainable and transparent infrastructure development worldwide. While ambitious in theory, the initiative has been <a href=\"https://www.idos-research.de/en/the-current-column/article/the-european-unions-global-gateway-should-reinforce-but-not-replace-its-development-policy/\">criticized</a> for its vague funding sources and sluggish rollout. It remains to be seen whether it can offer a viable counterbalance to China\u2019s global infrastructure diplomacy.</p>\r\n<p>The Belt and Road Initiative is undoubtedly reshaping global trade and politics. But as history has shown, from the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s to the Asian financial meltdown in 1997, unchecked borrowing and opaque financial agreements can have devastating consequences. With the BRI, the greatest threat may not be the size of the debt, but the legal scaffolding that comes with it. These legal Trojan horses don\u2019t arrive with fanfare or force; they slip in through contract law, binding countries into decades-long relationships that are hard to break. Without robust international oversight, transparent contract standards, and genuine avenues for renegotiation, the BRI risks becoming less a partnership and more a quiet, contractual surrender of sovereignty.</p>"
