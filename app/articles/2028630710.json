    "body": "<p>Since its inception in 1980, Dragon Ball, the popular anime and manga written by Japanese author Akira Toriyama, has transcended its original purpose and emerged as a global icon. Arguably one of Japan\u2019s most notable pieces of media, Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential franchises in recent history. Its impact on pop culture and insurmountable popularity has changed the genre and audience of anime forever and helped globalize Japanese media. Unfortunately, on March 1, 2024, Toriyama passed away. This has spurred the topic of his impact on the industry and to what extent he has globalized anime. I concur with my previous statements on Dragon Ball\u2019s effect on media in Japan and the world.</p>\r\n<p>In its early stages, Dragon Ball found it challenging to appeal to audiences in Western countries due to the lack of subtitles, making it relatively underground outside of Japan. However, in 1998, a dub premiered, and the show\u2019s popularity skyrocketed. It quickly became influential in the creation of future American cartoons, having references in popular 2000s shows such as The Amazing World Of Gumball, Adventure Time, Johnny Bravo, and practically every American cartoon released at this time. Dragon Ball\u2019s influence didn\u2019t stop there; if you were a kid or adult who wasn\u2019t a fan of cartoons, Dragon Ball found its way into TV shows and movies as well, such as The Matrix, Two and a Half Men, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and many more. Almost every bit of media coming from the Western world after Dragon Ball\u2019s Dub Air in 1998 includes some reference or homage to Yoriyama\u2019s work.</p>\r\n<p>While Dragon Ball was making waves in the West, it also took over Japanese media and inspired hundreds of Manga artists. Many people who\u2019ve indulged in pop culture over the past twenty years have most likely heard the term \u201cThe Big 3\u201d. This is about the Anime and Manga, Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach. They earned these names since their manga was the highest-selling at that time. All of which were heavily influenced by Akira Toriyama. Eiichiro Oda, the author of One Piece, which is the most popular and successful Anime and Manga of all time, stated this after the death of Toyiama, \u201cThe thought of never seeing you again fills me with sadness. I\u2019ve admired you so much since I was a child\u2026\u201d Practically every shounen, manga/anime primarily created for boys that has a lot of action or fighting, anime created in the past twenty years has been heavily influenced by Toriyama as stated by their authors. Like Dragon Ball, these anime have taken the West by storm in their media and merchandise.</p>\r\n<p>Outside of Asian and Western media, Dragon Ball has heavily impacted Japan\u2019s economy. Through Dragon Ball, merchandise and licensing, tourism, partnerships, and Japanese export of culture have all boosted Japan\u2019s economic growth. In an article from 2009, it is stated that Japan used its push of anime and manga to create 500,000 jobs, \u201cAs part of 15 trillion yen of fresh stimulus measures unveiled today, Japan hopes to raise the percentage of its exports of \u201csoft power\u201d - manga, animated films, video games and pop music - from 2% of the total to 18% over the next decade, creating half a million jobs.\u201d Dragon Ball clothing is everywhere, having partnered with giants such as Adidas, Uniqlo, BAPE, and Zara. Similarly, as video games have been a massive source of entertainment, Dragon Ball has also continued to find its way into the industry. From 1986 to 2020, 154 unique video games were produced. It is estimated that a little over 70 million units of the different Dragon Ball video games are sold throughout Japan and the West.</p>\r\n<p>As of 2024, Dragon Ball is the most notable and famous media ever created. Known throughout the world for his golden flowing hair, Goku and his dragon balls are identified throughout languages and borders. Dragon Ball singlehandedly revolutionized the Japanese anime industry and created thousands of jobs. Although dead at such an early age, Akira Toriyama has created a story that will live on in the hearts of many for years to come.</p>"
