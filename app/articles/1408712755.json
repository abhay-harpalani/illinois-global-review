    "body": "<p>Over the past decade (2015\u20132025), EU-India relations have taken a sharp turn from slow-moving trade talks to full-speed negotiations. Shifting global alliances, economic ambitions and interests, and a dose of geopolitical drama have reshaped the dynamic between Brussels and New Delhi, while the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/\">changing leadership in Washington</a> adds another layer of urgency and uncertainty. This evolving partnership has been shaped by trade negotiations, strategic collaborations, and India\u2019s careful <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/india-russia-and-the-ukraine-war\">balancing act</a> between the West and Russia. </p>\r\n<p>Tensions briefly flared in 2022 over <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-sanctions-against-india-for-purchasing-refining-russian-oil-us-treasury-officials/article68028509.ece\">India\u2019s increased Russian oil imports</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.usip.org/publications/2025/01/can-india-advance-peace-ukraine\">neutral stance</a> on the Russia-Ukraine war, frustrating many EU leaders. However,  Brussels has since taken a pragmatic approach, prioritizing India\u2019s growing role in trade and supply chains over political disagreements.</p>\r\n<p>For years, EU-India relations were marked by missed opportunities and stalled trade talks, despite strong economic ties. The EU has long been one of <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/03/eu-india-free-trade-agreement/\">India\u2019s top trading partners</a>, with bilateral trade reaching \u20ac124 billion in 2023, accounting for 12.2% of India\u2019s total trade. However, efforts to negotiate a <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/03/eu-india-free-trade-agreement/\">Free Trade Agreement (FTA)</a>, launched in 2007, were suspended in 2013, largely due to disagreements over market access, labor standards, and agriculture protections.</p>\r\n<p>India\u2019s historically high tariffs and reluctance to open its agricultural sector were key sticking points, while the EU\u2019s strict regulatory demands frustrated New Delhi. Additionally, India traditionally focused more on <a href=\"https://www.cer.eu/insights/its-time-upgrade-eu-india-relationship\">individual European nations</a> rather than the EU as a bloc, while Brussels prioritized relations with China and the U.S \u2014keeping India at arm\u2019s length. These factors kept the relationship transactional rather than strategic\u2014until now.</p>\r\n<p>At the center of this shift is <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Brussels\">Brussels</a>\u2014not just another European capital, but the beating heart of the European Union. It houses the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/index_en\">European Commission</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/\">European Council</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en\">European Parliament</a>\u2014the very institutions that dictate EU trade policies, foreign relations, and sanctions regimes. When Brussels signals a shift in its India policy, it\u2019s not just about a bilateral trade deal\u2014it\u2019s about the entire EU recalibrating its approach to India in an era of global uncertainty.</p>\r\n<p>Compounding these changes and uncertainties, Washington\u2019s latest trade war has introduced further urgency into EU-India negotiations. On February 25, 2025, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05ml3q2gn7o\">U.S. reinstated 25% tariffs</a> on all foreign steel and aluminum under <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/issues/trade-enforcement/section-232-steel\">Section 232</a>, hitting both European and Indian exporters hard. Further tensions arose when Trump threatened across-the-board 10\u201320% tariffs on all imports, singling out <a href=\"https://zeenews.india.com/india/trump-has-made-tariffs-household-name-congress-leader-jairam-ramesh-2869827.html\">India\u2019s \u201chigh tariff policies\u201d</a>\u2014a move that could cost <a href=\"https://www.northeasternchronicle.in/news/donald-trump-announces-tariffs-2/\">Indian exporters up to $7 billion annually</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The EU vowed <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/g-s1-53280/european-union-us-metals-tariffs\">retaliatory measures</a> in response to U.S. tariffs, while India began looking beyond Washington for trade partnerships. With both under pressure, the urgency to diversify trade dependencies pushed the EU-India trade deal forward.</p>\r\n<p>Against this backdrop, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen led a historic <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/article/in-the-wake-of-trump-the-eus-chance-to-redefine-its-india-relationship/\">two-day visit to India</a> on February 27\u201328, 2025, bringing 22 European Commissioners\u2014the first-ever full College of Commissioners visit outside Europe. This underscored Brussels\u2019 commitment to elevating ties with New Delhi.</p>\r\n<p>The meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi focused on <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/business/india-and-eu-target-historic-free-trade-agreement-by-year-end-3763691/lite/\">finalizing the long-delayed FTA</a>by the end of 2025, expanding technology collaboration, and strengthening security cooperation. Leaders also launched a <a href=\"https://www.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu/index_en\">Green Hydrogen Partnership</a> and explored new initiatives in semiconductors, AI, and space technology.</p>\r\n<p>Security took center stage, with von der Leyen announcing an <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-eu-eyeing-defence-and-security-partnership-agree-to-work-towards-free-open-indo-pacific/articleshow/118632180.cms?from=mdr\">EU-India Security and Defense Partnership</a>, marking Europe\u2019s increasing role in the Indo-Pacific. Discussions covered counterterrorism, cyber defense, and maritime security, reflecting shared concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness. Another major highlight was Europe\u2019s endorsement of the <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/2023/12/the-india-middle-east-europe-economic-corridor-imec-too-little-too-late?lang=en\">India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)</a>, a <a href=\"http://g20.in/en/about-g20/about-g20.html\">G20</a>-backed trade route linking India, the Middle East, and Europe. Von der Leyen called it \u201ca modern golden road\u201d, presenting it as a direct alternative to China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/09/what-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-bri\">Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)</a>.</p>\r\n<p>A centerpiece of the summit was the second meeting of the EU-India Trade and Technology Council (TTC), first established in 2022. This forum has become a critical platform for cooperation in technology, trade, and supply chains. <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_25_643\">Three working groups</a> were formalized during the visit:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><p>Strategic Technologies, Digital Governance, and Connectivity \u2013 Focuses on AI, semiconductors, 6G, and cybersecurity. The EU and India agreed to enhance chip supply chains and align digital regulations, including interoperability in digital payments.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Clean and Green Technologies \u2013 Centers on renewable energy and hydrogen development. A <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_25_643\">\u20ac60 million joint fund</a> was announced to develop battery recycling, waste-to-hydrogen projects, and sustainable EV solutions.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Trade, Investment, and Resilient Value Chains \u2013 Addresses supply chain security in pharmaceuticals, agri-food, and critical minerals. Both sides committed to reducing reliance on <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/blog/critical-materials-are-high-demand.-what-dod-doing-secure-supply-chain-and-stockpile-these-resources\">China and securing alternative sources for raw materials</a>.</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>One of the most symbolic moments came when von der Leyen endorsed India\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/product-overview\">Unified Payments Interface (UPI)</a>, calling it \u201ca game-changer for digital transactions\u201d, signaling Europe\u2019s interest in India\u2019s fintech success and digital trade expansion.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond economics, geopolitical shifts are bringing India and the EU closer. Europe\u2019s skepticism of <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/chinas-economic-headwinds\">China\u2019s economic dominance</a>, cyber threats, and coercive policies has grown, while India\u2019s efforts to <a href=\"https://defencesecurityasia.com/en/india-finalizes-7-6-billion-rafale-m-deal-with-france-enhancing-naval-air-power/#google_vignette\">reduce reliance</a> on <a href=\"https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/02/11/russia-struggles-to-keep-india-dependent-on-its-arms-supplies-a87940\">Russian military</a> equipment have opened the door for European defense collaboration. The EU has invited Indian firms to co-develop defense technologies, marking a significant shift in security cooperation. The two sides also agreed to expand joint naval exercises and protect undersea data cables, reinforcing <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eu-indo-pacific-strategy-topic_en#:~:text=The%20EU%20prioritizes%20upholding%20a,shared%20prosperity%20in%20the%20region.\">Europe\u2019s 2021 Indo-Pacific Strategy</a>, which identifies India as a key security partner.</p>\r\n<p>The February 2025 summit has set the stage for a major shift in EU-India relations, but <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/indias-eu-trade-deal-faces-a-costly-hurdle-due-to-strict-laws/articleshow/118817708.cms?from=mdr\">challenges remain</a>. The long-delayed <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/free-trade-agreement-overview\">FTA</a> still faces hurdles, with market access disputes, tariff disagreements, and regulatory complexities yet to be resolved. Domestic opposition in India\u2014particularly from agricultural and small-business sectors concerned about European competition\u2014adds another layer of uncertainty, while Brussels continues to push for stricter labor rights, sustainability standards, and digital regulations.</p>\r\n<p>With U.S. trade policies uncertain and China\u2019s influence expanding, Europe and India are no longer just economic allies\u2014they are emerging as geopolitical partners shaping the future of global trade, security, and technology. However, <a href=\"https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/breaking-deadlock-eu-india-fta\">challenges remain</a>\u2014from stalled FTA negotiations over market access and labor standards to domestic opposition in India against opening key sectors to European competition. As both sides navigate these roadblocks, the real test will be whether political will can turn ambition into action.</p>"
